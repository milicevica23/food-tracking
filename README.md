Todo
- introduce dagster
- introduce dbt
- create separate dashbords for ingredients and allergens
- learn about github local ci/cd agent

Questions:
- How to refresh evidence from dagster when dbt model is ready? Currently it is doing data preparation and dashboard deployment with data from CI/CD pipeline
